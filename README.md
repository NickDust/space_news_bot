## Lessons Learned:
Working on this Telegram bot it allowed me to apply everything I’ve learned about Python — from API integration and asynchronous programming to database management with PostgreSQL. Throughout this project, I’ve challenged myself to write cleaner, more efficient code, improve error handling, and design scalable logic for multiple users. Most importantly, it strengthened my passion for continuous learning and building real-world applications that connect code, data, and creativity.
